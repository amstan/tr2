## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a hardware and accompanying software
platform for controlling robots from a high level programming language such as
Python.

## Hardware

The hardware will consist of a multi-axis motor control board, industrial
strength GPIO for controlling alarms, incandescent lamps, driving fans and more.

## Software

The software will provide an abstract interface to the hardware platform. The
first robot that will be tailored to this project will be a 3-axis Delta Robot.

## Project Structure

Here is the folder structure for the project:

* blender/
    * 3D models of target robots
* board-1/
    * The first hardware platform for this project
* python/
    * The python software interfaces
* ui/
    * A user interface to all of this
